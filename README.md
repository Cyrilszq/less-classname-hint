# less-classname-hint README

This extension is inspired by [IntelliSense for CSS class names in HTML](https://github.com/Zignd/HTML-CSS-Class-Completion). I want to support less or scss but that just support css. By the way I want to learn how to write a vscode extension.

## Features
* Gives you autocompletion for less class definitions that can be found in your workspace
* Command to manually re-cache the class definitions used in the autocompletion


## Usage

* Press `F1` and input `Cache classname`
* Click `cache classname` on the status bar


**Enjoy!**
